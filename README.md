  ## Product Description
Empowering Every Mind to Learn with Confidence.

Our product is a learning support platform specifically designed for individuals with dyslexia. It aims to make the learning journey easier, more accessible, and more enjoyable for students who face reading and writing challenges.

Whether a child is struggling to read fluently or a teenager needs better tools to organize their thoughts, our app provides personalized educational experiences to help them succeed in the classroom and beyond.

What does it offer?

    ✅ Interactive lessons using visual, auditory, and kinesthetic techniques

    ✅ Text-to-speech and speech-to-text support

    ✅ Gamified learning modules to keep motivation high

    ✅ Progress tracking for parents and teachers

    ✅ Exercises focused on building confidence, comprehension, and memory

We believe that dyslexia is not a limitation, but a different way of thinking. Our mission is to give every learner the tools they need to thrive, regardless of how they read or write.

    <summary><h2>Target Audience</h2></summary>
    <p>zaten's target audience primarily consists of Millennials and Gen Z who value access over ownership and are open to sharing resources. These younger generations are interested in renting various items such as electronics, fashion accessories, sports equipment, and tools. Urban dwellers, especially those in smaller apartments or shared living spaces, who have limited storage, prefer renting items like camping gear, home appliances, and furniture. Travelers and tourists with specific needs during their trips, as well as event planners requiring temporary access to equipment, are also potential users of zaten's app. Additionally, sustainable consumers who care about the environment and reducing waste can be attracted by emphasizing the role of sharing resources in achieving sustainability goals.</p>

  - **Sprint Notes**:
    - It has been decided to use `Trello` for project management.

    - It has been decided to use `Figma` for UI designs.

    - It has been decided to use `Riverpod` for state management.

    - The `MVVM` structure has been set up and it will be proceeded on this basis.

    - It has been decided to use `Firebase` for the backend, and the `GetX` system for the page routing system.

    - It was decided to use `email login` for the login system.

    - It was decided to perform `identity verification` following the login system.

    - It has been decided to use `Hive` as the local database.
  - **Expected point completion within Sprint**: 200 points
  - **Point Completion Logic**: `(205 points completed)` The first sprint has a target of 200 points, the second sprint 100 points, and the third sprint 200 points. A lower point target has been set for the second sprint since there is a national holiday in Turkey during this period and all team members are residing in Turkey.
  - **Daily Scrum**: See file
  - **Product Backlog URL:** Click for Backlog (Trello)
  - **Sprint Review:**
    - Arda and Burak carried out a coordinated effort for the backend and frontend. We have agreed within the team to continue this way in the next sprint.

    - We struggled to decide on an application name for a while. We transitioned from 'zaten' to 'zaten' and took another step towards branding by purchasing the 'zaten.app' domain for the name.

    - The two biggest problems we encountered in this sprint were difficulty in deciding on a color palette and not having completed the logo yet.

    - We learned that the FloatingActionButton usage in the BottomNavigationBar and the notched feature of the navigation bar have been removed in Material 3, we overcame this issue by designing it ourselves.

    - Overall, we believe we had a good sprint process. We experienced a sprint process close to what we planned.

  - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Burak Taha Cevheroğlu`, `Arda Demirel`, `Dila Hazal Bilgin`, `Merve Ağaçayak`, `Onur Konuk`
  - **Sprint Retrospective:**
    - In the second sprint, it was decided in the team meeting that only Arda and Burak would write code for mobile.

    - In the second sprint, we decided to write our own API (for location information).

    - We had to postpone the logo design to the second sprint. We will continue with the design.

    - We will continue to develop the local database system (Hive).

    - As Burak and Arda will continue more with software related tasks, much of the project management has been delegated to the remaining team members.

    - In the second sprint, we will start writing a website for the zaten.app domain we bought for brand recognition. This task has been handed over to Onur.

    - It was decided to establish a review system before the product goes live during the second sprint.

    - For brand recognition and marketing purposes, it was decided to open an Instagram account during the second sprint.

    - In addition to email authentication, it was decided to add the Google auth system in the second sprint.

    - It was decided to add test AdMobs in the second sprint.

    - We decided to start localization and the first languages will be English and Turkish.

    - It was decided to add a user-to-user SDK with the Stream Chat SDK in the second sprint.
