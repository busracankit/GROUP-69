  - **Sprint Notes**:
    - It has been decided to use `Trello` for project management.

    - It has been decided to use `Figma` for UI designs.

    - It has been decided to use `Riverpod` for state management.

    - The `MVVM` structure has been set up and it will be proceeded on this basis.

    - It has been decided to use `Firebase` for the backend, and the `GetX` system for the page routing system.

    - It was decided to use `email login` for the login system.

    - It was decided to perform `identity verification` following the login system.

    - It has been decided to use `Hive` as the local database.
  - **Expected point completion within Sprint**: 200 points
  - **Point Completion Logic**: `(205 points completed)` The first sprint has a target of 200 points, the second sprint 100 points, and the third sprint 200 points. A lower point target has been set for the second sprint since there is a national holiday in Turkey during this period and all team members are residing in Turkey.
  - **Daily Scrum**: See file
  - **Product Backlog URL:** Click for Backlog (Trello)
  - **Sprint Review:**
    - Arda and Burak carried out a coordinated effort for the backend and frontend. We have agreed within the team to continue this way in the next sprint.

    - We struggled to decide on an application name for a while. We transitioned from 'zaten' to 'zaten' and took another step towards branding by purchasing the 'zaten.app' domain for the name.

    - The two biggest problems we encountered in this sprint were difficulty in deciding on a color palette and not having completed the logo yet.

    - We learned that the FloatingActionButton usage in the BottomNavigationBar and the notched feature of the navigation bar have been removed in Material 3, we overcame this issue by designing it ourselves.

    - Overall, we believe we had a good sprint process. We experienced a sprint process close to what we planned.

  - **Sprint Review Participants:** `Burak Taha Cevheroğlu`, `Arda Demirel`, `Dila Hazal Bilgin`, `Merve Ağaçayak`, `Onur Konuk`
  - **Sprint Retrospective:**
    - In the second sprint, it was decided in the team meeting that only Arda and Burak would write code for mobile.

    - In the second sprint, we decided to write our own API (for location information).

    - We had to postpone the logo design to the second sprint. We will continue with the design.

    - We will continue to develop the local database system (Hive).

    - As Burak and Arda will continue more with software related tasks, much of the project management has been delegated to the remaining team members.

    - In the second sprint, we will start writing a website for the zaten.app domain we bought for brand recognition. This task has been handed over to Onur.

    - It was decided to establish a review system before the product goes live during the second sprint.

    - For brand recognition and marketing purposes, it was decided to open an Instagram account during the second sprint.

    - In addition to email authentication, it was decided to add the Google auth system in the second sprint.

    - It was decided to add test AdMobs in the second sprint.

    - We decided to start localization and the first languages will be English and Turkish.

    - It was decided to add a user-to-user SDK with the Stream Chat SDK in the second sprint.
