<summary><h2>Product Description</h2></summary>
LetStep is an AI-powered, web-based educational platform designed to support individuals diagnosed with dyslexia in developing their reading, comprehension, and learning skills. It makes learning more accessible and sustainable through personalized exercises tailored to each individual's cognitive profile.

The platform analyzes users' needs based on their age, learning level, and pace, evaluating data such as reading habits and attention patterns to deliver customized content. With the support of artificial intelligence and data science, the difficulty level of the exercises is dynamically adjusted.

LetStep's clean and focus-friendly interface helps users with dyslexia stay engaged with the content. The built-in text-to-speech and feedback systems support auditory learning, transforming the platform into a digital learning coach.

Additionally, a dedicated monitoring panel enables parents and education specialists to track progress in real time and provide timely guidance and intervention when needed.
What does it offer?

    ✅ Interactive lessons using visual, auditory, and kinesthetic techniques

    ✅ Text-to-speech and speech-to-text support

    ✅ Adaptive reading modes (font, spacing, color filters)

    ✅ Gamified learning modules to keep motivation high

    ✅ Progress tracking for parents and teachers

    ✅ Exercises focused on building confidence, comprehension, and memory

We believe that dyslexia is not a limitation, but a different way of thinking. Our mission is to give every learner the tools they need to thrive, regardless of how they read or write.
