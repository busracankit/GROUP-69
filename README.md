<summary><h2>Product Description</h2></summary>
LetStep is an AI-powered, web-based educational platform designed to support individuals diagnosed with dyslexia in developing their reading, comprehension, and learning skills. It makes learning more accessible and sustainable through personalized exercises tailored to each individual's cognitive profile.

The platform analyzes users' needs based on their age, learning level, and pace, evaluating data such as reading habits and attention patterns to deliver customized content. With the support of artificial intelligence and data science, the difficulty level of the exercises is dynamically adjusted.

LetStep's clean and focus-friendly interface helps users with dyslexia stay engaged with the content. The built-in text-to-speech and feedback systems support auditory learning, transforming the platform into a digital learning coach.

Additionally, a dedicated monitoring panel enables parents and education specialists to track progress in real time and provide timely guidance and intervention when needed.
What does it offer?

    ✅ Interactive lessons using visual, auditory, and kinesthetic techniques

    ✅ Text-to-speech and speech-to-text support

    ✅ Adaptive reading modes (font, spacing, color filters)

    ✅ Gamified learning modules to keep motivation high

    ✅ Progress tracking for parents and teachers

    ✅ Exercises focused on building confidence, comprehension, and memory

We believe that dyslexia is not a limitation, but a different way of thinking. Our mission is to give every learner the tools they need to thrive, regardless of how they read or write.

 🧾 Sprint 3 Review Summaries

    1 - During Sprint 3, significant progress was achieved, marking the completion of the project’s final development phase. A total of 12 core exercises were successfully integrated into the backend, and new exercises were added. Additionally, the AI-powered flashcard system and the Reading Assistant module were finalized and connected with real user data.

    2 - Given the broad scope and final nature of this sprint, task prioritization became more intense, especially as UI polishing, backend stabilization, and integration efforts were required in parallel.

    3 - Key focus areas during this sprint included the individual development panel, where weekly progress and detailed daily analyses were merged into a unified view. The admin panel was also finalized, both in terms of functionality and visual refinement.

    4 - Backend-frontend API integrations were essential throughout Sprint 3, especially to connect the analytics, reporting, and personalization layers of the system.
    
    5 - Major interface components such as the dashboard, parent panel, student progress views, and admin report sections were all made fully functional. Additional efforts were placed on CSS styling and visual consistency.

    6 - System debugging, backend adjustments, and real-data testing were completed by Furkan and Kemal. Their work ensured the platform was fully stable, reliable, and ready for final deployment.

    7 - Daily Scrum meetings continued regularly via Microsoft Teams, facilitating consistent progress tracking and prompt resolution of blockers.

    8 - Unlike previous sprints, this sprint began with well-defined tasks and deadlines. The team utilized Notion more actively for date tracking and burndown chart generation, which improved visibility into sprint health.

    9 - Sprint 3 was not only productive but also conclusive, as it brought together all core modules—user, parent, and admin sides—into a cohesive and fully functional application. It also included documentation efforts, a feature demo video, and preparations for post-sprint presentation.

🔄 Sprint 3 Retrospective Decisions

    1 - The development model architecture was finalized with all modules fully integrated and aligned with the application’s functional goals.
    
    2 - Admin panel report data was successfully prepared and integrated by Büşra, Elif, and Alina, ensuring a complete and functional analytics view.
    
    3 - Backend and frontend structuring of the admin panel was completed by Furkan and Kemal, including design improvements and backend logic refinements.
    
    4 - The personalization model results were analyzed and used effectively within the individual development panel and disleksi flashcard modules.
    
    5 - The progress tracking graphs were visually enhanced and optimized for clarity, especially in the General Overview and Exercise-Based Weekly Progress sections.
    
    6 - Filtering and sorting options were introduced into the development dashboard, allowing users and admins to better navigate student data.
    
    7 - User interfaces for both the student and parent panels were improved for simplicity and usability, with visual consistency across all screens.
    
    8 - Data synchronization between backend and frontend was successfully stabilized through API adjustments and final bug fixes.
    
    9 - The Reading Assistant was improved and integrated with the Flashcard Module. While using the assistant, users can now review their mispronounced words, compare them with correct pronunciations, and listen to accurate audio feedback for better learning.
    
    10 - New development ideas were discussed, and the most promising suggestions were recorded for potential implementation.

🔧 Development Ideas
    
    🧒 Student-Centered Feature Proposals
     
      🧠 Emotional Reflection Panel
           A dedicated interface where students are prompted to reflect on their emotions regularly. For younger learners, emoji-based responses are used. This emotional data is then incorporated into weekly performance analytics to better understand the correlation between emotional state and academic progress.

      ✏️ Creative Expression Notebook ("Dream Journal")
           Students are provided with specific words—ideally those they struggle with—and asked to write short stories using them. This not only reinforces vocabulary retention but also encourages creative thinking and narrative skills. In future iterations, students may be invited to complement their stories with drawings.

      🔍 Letter Microscope Interaction
           A playful learning module where students interact with letters by zooming in, revealing animated visuals of objects that start with the selected letter (e.g., zooming into the letter "B" reveals a balloon, a bike, a ball). This strengthens letter-sound associations through visual reinforcement and interactive engagement.
